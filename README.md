# Priority Queue GUI

This is a Java desktop application developed for a high school teacher to show a binary heap priority queue. The user is able to add numerical ID/Inventory pairs where the priority queue is based on the item ID. This application can be used as a tool to demonstrate adding and removing from a binary heap implementation of a priority queue. The application also demonstrates proper functionality of a Priority Queue class written using an ArrayList class written from scratch. The user is able to quickly load item ID/Inventory pairs from file20.txt for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

Run PriorityQueueGUI.jar as an executable Java program to start; no other files are required. If on a Linux machine, make sure Right Click > Properties > Permissions > "Allow executing file as a program" is checked. The Java files included in the PriorityQueue folder are for development purposes and are not needed for normal use of the program. File20.txt is included for easy access and reference.
