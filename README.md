# Priority Queue GUI

This is a Java based GUI application that visually shows a binary heap/priority queue with min-heap ordering. The user is able to add numerical ID/Inventory pairs where the priority queue is based on the item ID. The application is to demonstrate proper functionality of a Priority Queue class written using an ArrayList class written from scratch. The user is able to load item ID/Inventory pairs from file20.txt for demonstration purposes. This application may be useful for demonstrating the process of adding and removing from a binary heap.

## Getting Started

Run PriorityQueueGUI.jar as an executable Java program to start; no other files are required. If on a Linux machine, make sure Right Click > Properties > Permissions > "Allow executing file as a program" is checked. The Java files included in the PriorityQueue folder are for development purposes and are not needed for normal use of the program. File20.txt is included for easy access and reference.
